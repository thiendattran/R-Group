# Introduction
1. Format: unified framework
  * codes
  * its results
  * prose commentary
2. features
  * .Rmd files: Develop your code and ideas side-by-side in a single document. Run code as individual chunks or as an entire document
  * Dynamic Documents · Knit together plots, tables, and results with narrative text. Render to a variety of formats like HTML, PDF, MS Word, or MS Powerpoint.
  *  Reproducible Research · Upload, link to, or attach your report to share. Anyone can read or run your code to reproduce your work.
3. Advantages: 
  * reproducible  
  * support dozens of output formats, like html, PDFs, Word files, slideshows, and more.
4. Guidance for R Markdown
  * R Markdown cheat sheet: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1AiImxk_SL6lJ1jTfOPU93BOunIwGk8TF 
  * R Mardow reference: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1AiImxk_SL6lJ1jTfOPU93BOunIwGk8TF

# R Markdown basic
1. This is an R Markdown file, a plain text file that has the extension .Rmd:
---
title: "Diamond sizes"
date: 2016-08-25
output: html_document
---
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only `r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than 2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r plot , echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)

```

* It contains three important types of content:
  + An (optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s.
  + Chunks of R code surrounded by ```.

2. To produce and share a complete report
* click “Knit” or press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K. The report will display the report in the viewer pane, and create a self-contained HTML file that you can share with others.
* When you knit the document, R Markdown sends the .Rmd file to knitr, http://yihui.name/knitr/, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and its output. The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by pandoc, http://pandoc.org/, which is responsible for creating the finished file. The advantage of this two step workflow is that you can create a very wide range of output formats, as you’ll learn about in R markdown formats.

# Code chunk
* to insert a chunk
  + The keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + I
  + The “Insert” button icon in the editor toolbar
  + By manually typing the chunk delimiters ```{r} and ```
  
* run code in a chunk
  + Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter or button green on the right side: run all codes in a chunk
  + Cmd/Ctrl + Enter: continue to run the code
  
* ```{r chunk name, followed by comma separated options}. The chunk end is indicated by a final ```.

*chunk options:
  + include = FALSE runs the code, but doesn’t show the code or results in the final document. Use this for setup code that you don’t want cluttering your report.
  + echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. Use this when writing reports aimed at people who don’t want to see the underlying R code.
  + message = FALSE or warning = FALSE prevents messages or warnings from appearing in the finished file.
  + results = 'hide' hides printed output; fig.show = 'hide' hides plots.
  + error = TRUE causes the render to continue even if code returns an error. 
  
1. Table
```{r}
mtcars[1:5, ]
knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:5, ], 
  caption = "A knitr kable."
)
```

2. Caching
* cache = TRUE. When set, this will save the output of the chunk to a specially named file on disk. On subsequent runs, knitr will check to see if the code has changed, and if it hasn’t, it will reuse the cached results.
```{r raw_data}
rawdata <- mtcars
rawdata
```


```{r processed_data, cache = TRUE}
processed_data <- rawdata %>% 
  filter(!is.na(mpg)) %>% 
  mutate(new_variable = mpg+1)
```
  
* Caching the processed_data chunk means that it will get re-run if the dplyr pipeline is changed, but it won’t get rerun if the **read_csv()** call changes. You can avoid that problem with the dependson chunk option:

''{r processed_data, cache = TRUE, dependson = "raw_data"}
processed_data <- rawdata %>% 
  filter(!is.na(import_var)) %>% 
  mutate(new_variable = complicated_transformation(x, y, z))''
  
* dependson should contain a character vector of every chunk that the cached chunk depends on. Knitr will update the results for the cached chunk whenever it detects that one of its dependencies have changed.

* Note that the chunks won’t update if a_very_large_file.csv changes, because knitr caching only tracks changes within the .Rmd file. If you want to also track changes to that file you can use the **cache.extra** option. A good function to use is **file.info()**: it returns a bunch of information about the file including when it was last modified. Then you can write:
``{r raw_data, cache.extra = file.info("a_very_large_file.csv")}
rawdata <- readr::read_csv("a_very_large_file.csv")
``

* As your caching strategies get progressively more complicated, it’s a good idea to regularly clear out all your caches with **knitr::clean_cache()**.

* global chung options: **knitr::opts_chunk$set()**

3. inline code
* To embed R code into an R Markdown document (tex) directly **`r `** (example diamond)

* To set number of digits
```{r}
comma <- function(x) format(x, digits = 2, big.mark = ",")
comma(3452345.123) # why does it not produce 3,452,345.12
comma(.12358124331)
```

4. YAML header
* Parameters
---
output: html_document
params:
  my_class: "suv"
---
''{r , include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

class <- mpg %>% filter(class == params$my_class)''
